## KAR Workshop - Bringing KAR Netplay To The Modern Era! ##

KAR Workshop is home to several projects with various goals all to unify netplay. Making it easier to play with others and record match data.

- [Patcher]() || Takes any vannilla Kirby Air Ride ROM and patches it for Netplay. We can not provide a ROM, you must bring your own.
- [Chop Shop]() || A custom mod tool for creating KAR mods in place of HSDRaw.

- [KARphin Frontend]() || The custom frontend we use for the netplay client
- [KAR Bootloader]() || Used to validate the install and get the latest updates and extra data.
- [KARphin]() || The modern netplay client designed to replace the old Slippi R10 build used before.
- [KARphin Tourny]() || The modifed R10 client designed for tourny play since it has improved input delay, will be replaced when KARphin gets input delay fixed.
- [KAR Jukebox]() || A modified version of the Slippi Jukebox given a custom GUI and KARphin integration. Used for playing music and other sounds.
- [KAR Common]() || The common static lib used everywhere for game IDs, replays, and other custom code needed in the projects.

- [KARDon't]() || The WIP Nintendon't fork for KAR Netplay

- [Warp Record - Replay Spec]() || The spec for the custom Replays generated by KARphin
